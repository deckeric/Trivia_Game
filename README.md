# Trivia_Game
A trivia game to play based on over 3000 trivia questions collected online.

Details:
This is a simple trivia game where any number of players can play to a score they choose. The trivia questions contain
both true/false questions as well as multiple choice questions.

Future workings:
I still need to create a way to separate the difficulty of the questions and separate them based on category (geography, math, etc).
After that I will be adding a GUI for easier and better presentation.
